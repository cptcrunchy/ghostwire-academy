                <h3>Register Student for IT Fundamentals (ITF)</h3>
                <p>ITF is the only single certification that covers all areas of IT foundations. Students will learn
about software, hardware, security, networking, and basic IT literacy. Students will prepare for
the CompTIA IT Fundamentals exam, and any student that passes our pre-test, will get to take
the CompTIA test for free!

                <h3>Cyber Security</h3>
                <p>GhostWire Academy's cyber security course introduces basic programming in order to develop, 
                    design &amp; construct common exploits. The course will then cover basic network analysis
                    techniques that enable the detection of vulnerabilities that could make a system, or network
                    of systems, vulnerable to those exploits.
                </p>
                <p>The objective of this course is to teach students how to discover vulnerabilities in systems,
                    or a network of systems, so that students will better understand how to defend their systems from exploits.
